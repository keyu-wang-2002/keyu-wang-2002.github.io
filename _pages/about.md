# Biography

Hi, I'm Keyu, a first-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Now I am advised by [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and  had the most wonderful times at [SEU-131AIClub](https://github.com/131AIClub), witnessing the organization grow from its founding to its flourishing.

Currently, My research interests cover <font color='FireBrick'><strong>Large Language Models, Machine Learning Systems, Reasoning, AI Efficiency and Trustworthy</strong></font>.  Particularly, I am keen on understanding how LLMs perform reasoning and eliciting it by <font color='FireBrick'><strong>inductive bias, low dimensionality and scaling</strong></font>, etc. During undergraduate research, I investigated broadly on  <font color='FireBrick'><strong>neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning</strong></font>, especially, reasoning[[EMNLP 2024]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.141/)[[IJCKG 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01664) and embedding[[DI 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01677) with knowledge graphs and description logic ontologies.
