# Biography

I am a first-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Currently I am advised by [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

Currently, my interests include <font color='FireBrick'><strong> large foundational models,  machine learning systems, AI Efficiency & Trustworthiness </strong></font>. During undergraduate research, I investigated broadly on  <font color='FireBrick'><strong>neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning</strong></font>, especially, inference[[EMNLP 2024]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.141/)[[IJCKG 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01664) and embedding[[ArXiv 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01677) with knowledge-based and web-based systems such as knowledge graphs and ontologies.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email, and you can find my <font color='FireBrick'><strong>CV</strong></font> [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyu-wang-2002/keyu-wang-2002.github.io/master/docs/CV.pdf).

# More About Me
- My Chinese name is 汪可予. 可(Ke)予(Yu) Keyu is my given name. "Ke" is pronounced with /kə:/ and "Yu" is pronounced with the German "ü" sound, the lip shape is rounder and positioned further forward in the mouth compared to the English "u". So you can pronounce me with /kə - ü/. 
- I like all kinds of sports, such as  basketball, table tennis, football, tennis, badminton, marathons, jogging, hiking and climbing.  Currently, I go to gym three times a week. My goal for 2025 is to meet the physical fitness standards of military personnel from various countries.
- I am a big fan of board and card games. German board games are great! My favorite games are Texas Hold'em Poker, "Guan Dan" (掼蛋， a popular Chinese card game), and "Jun Qi" (军棋/Kriegspiel/Chinese Army Chess). I used to be extremely passionate about strategy games like Civilization VI and varients of Plant v.s. Zombie.
- I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading, music, animation and movie.
- I dream of being a principle investigator between my 30 - 70, and being a writer after I get retired at 70 years old.
