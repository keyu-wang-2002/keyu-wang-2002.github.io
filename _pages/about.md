# Biography

Hi, I'm Keyu, a first-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Now I am advised by [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

Currently, I am particularly interested in <font color='FireBrick'><strong>   Effective & Efficient LLM Reasoning</strong></font>, which covers a wide range of topics like MLSys, LLMs, CoT, Self-consistency, Test-time scaling, Logic, AI Efficiency and Trustworthy. During undergraduate research, I investigated broadly on  <font color='FireBrick'><strong>neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning</strong></font>, especially, reasoning[[EMNLP 2024]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.141/)[[IJCKG 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01664) and embedding[[DI 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01677) with knowledge graphs and description logic ontologies. You can find my <font color='FireBrick'><strong>CV</strong></font> [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyu-wang-2002/keyu-wang-2002.github.io/master/docs/CV_2025_June_2.pdf) (last updated in May 2025).
