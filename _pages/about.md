# Biography

Hi, I'm Keyu, a second-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Currently, I’m working with  [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io) and [Dr. Jonas Geiping](https://jonasgeiping.github.io/) on efficient LLMs. I earned my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and had a wonderful time at [SEU-131AIClub](https://github.com/131AIClub), contributing to its founding and flourishing.

My current research focuses on <font color='FireBrick'><strong> efficient and scalable foundation models</strong></font>. Below are some areas I am particularly passionate about: 
- <strong>Reasoning: </strong> Why do LLMs have reasoning capabilities? What are we missing behind scaling laws?  How to capture uncertainty over intermediate reasoning states?
- <strong>Optimization & Efficiency: </strong> How to effectively and efficiently optimize deep models? How does changing a low-dimensional weights' subspace allow a pre-trained model to adapt to downstream tasks? What limits inference efficiency, and how to do more with less I/O?
- <strong>Beyond SOTA in generative models: </strong> Do current benchmarks really capture how models behave, not just how they score and rank?

During undergraduate research, I broadly investigated on  neuro-symbolic <strong>knowledge representation and reasoning</strong>, especially, handling of incomplete or inconsistent knowledge bases, and <strong>description logics</strong>. <!--Recently, I’ve begun to examine the systematic limitations of existing end-to-end VLA approaches and to revisit the problem from the perspective of knowledge representation and reasoning—namely, how to enable machines to understand concepts of the physical world so that natural language can be mapped to high-dimensional continuous control via key bridges such as task logic, physical constraints, and spatial geometry. -->

I am open to research collaborations as well as internship or visiting opportunities. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at​ ​**keyu.wang@student.uni-tuebingen.de**.

# Misc
- My Chinese name is 汪可予. I come from Tongling, Anhui — a small city by the Yangtze River.
- I like all kinds of sports, such as table tennis, basketball, football, tennis, badminton, marathons, swimming, jogging, hiking and climbing.  I also occasionally bowl and play billiards with my friends. Currently, I go to gym three times a week. My goal for ~~2025~~2026 is to meet the physical fitness standards of military personnel from various countries.
- I enjoy animations. I am a big fan of various chess, board and card games. My favorite games are Texas Hold'em Poker, "Jun Qi" (Chinese Military Chess), PVZ and Civilization VI.
