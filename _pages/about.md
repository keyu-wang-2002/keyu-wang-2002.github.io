# Biography

I am a first-year graduate student in Machine Learning at the [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

Currently, my research interests include <font color='FireBrick'><strong>large language models, mathematical reasoning, casual inference, web science & social networks, machine learning</strong></font>. My previous interests cover neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning, especially, embedding and inference with knowledge-based and web-based systems such as knowledge graphs and ontologies.

I am actively seeking research internship, research collaborations and potantial PhD supervisors. If you find my profile intriguing, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, and you can find my CV [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuyao233/yinghaocai/master/docs/CV.pdf). You can contact me at​ ​**keyu.wang@student.uni-tuebingen.de**
