# Biography

Hi, I'm Keyu, ~~an AI Alchemist~~ a first-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Currently, I’m working with [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io) on LLMs pruning and reasoning. I earned my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also  had a wonderful time at [SEU-131AIClub](https://github.com/131AIClub), witnessing and contributing to its growth from founding to flourishing.

Currently, my research interests cover <font color='FireBrick'><strong>Large Language Models, Machine Learning Systems, Reasoning, AI Efficiency and Trustworthy</strong></font>.  Particularly, I am keen on understanding how LLMs perform reasoning and eliciting its effectiveness and efficiency in long-context reasoning scenarios. During undergraduate research, I focused on  <font color='FireBrick'><strong>neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning</strong></font>, especially, reasoning and embedding with knowledge graphs and description logic ontologies. 

I am open to research collaborations as well as internship or visiting opportunities. You can find my CV [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyu-wang-2002/keyu-wang-2002.github.io/master/docs/Keyu-CV-25-Aug.pdf) and please feel free to reach out to me via email at​ ​**keyu.wang@student.uni-tuebingen.de**.
