# Biography

Hi, I'm Keyu, a first-year master student in Machine Learning at [University of Tuebingen]([[https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/]]). Currently, I’m working with [Dr. Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io) on efficient LLMs. I earned my B.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guilin Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gw3LJQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also  had a wonderful time at [SEU-131AIClub](https://github.com/131AIClub), witnessing and contributing to its growth from founding to flourishing.

I am passionate about finding emerging questions in <font color='FireBrick'><strong>scaling pretraining, post-training, and test-time computing</strong></font> with compute, models, and data — spanning reasoning capability, expressiveness, efficiency, robustness, generalization, and trustworthness, etc — and on seeking elegant solutions from both system and algorithmic perspectives. Particularly, I am keen on understanding how LLMs perform <font color='FireBrick'><strong>reasoning</strong></font> and eliciting its effectiveness and efficiency in complex reasoning scenarios. During undergraduate research, I broadly investigated on  neuro-symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning, especially, handling of incomplete, uncertain or inconsistent knowledge bases, and description logics. 

I am open to research collaborations as well as internship or visiting opportunities. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at​ ​**keyu.wang@student.uni-tuebingen.de**.

# Misc
- My Chinese name is 汪可予. I come from Tongling, Anhui — a small city by the Yangtze River.
- I like all kinds of sports, such as table tennis, basketball, football, tennis, badminton, marathons, swimming, jogging, hiking and climbing.  I also occasionally bowl and play billiards with my friends. Currently, I go to gym three times a week. My goal for ~~2025~~2026 is to meet the physical fitness standards of military personnel from various countries.
- I enjoy animations, movies and music. I am a big fan of various chess, board and card games. My favorite games are Texas Hold'em Poker, "Jun Qi" (Chinese Military Chess), PVZ and Civilization VI.
